Frequently Asked Questions
==========================================

Why do I receive a "hidapi write error"?
----------------------------------------

This normally happens when a USB connection is still open to the brick. Run ``delete(b)`` (where ``b`` is the variable for the brick) to end the connection. If this doesn't work, restart Matlab.

My card doesn't let me in to the New Cellars
--------------------------------------------

First of all, make sure that you're using your plain white Pembroke card. (The Union and the King's cards won't work.)

Next, go to the Pembroke main gate, and refresh your card permissions by touching your card against the grey box. If you're unsure where to do it, ask for help at the Porters' Lodge.

If your card still doesn't work, get in touch with the instructors and the PKP course management.

The brick doesn't connect to the wireless
-----------------------------------------

You can confirm that the wireless dongle works by checking whether the blue light on the dongle is on/blinking.

If it is not, try the following steps:

#. Turn off the brick.
#. Unplug the dongle.
#. Turn on the brick.
#. Once turned on, plug in the dongle.

The blue light should be on/blinking now, and you should be able to connect.
