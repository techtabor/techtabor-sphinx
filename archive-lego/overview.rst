Course Overview
==========================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the PKP Lego Robot Workshop! In the next few weeks through this course you will gain some insight into engineering design, experience the challenges of programming, and you will get a taster of project planning and coordinated teamwork.

The core of the workshop is the Lego EV3 brick (below). It is a small Linux machine running on an ARM processor. You will use Matlab, a scientific programming language to program the EV3 brick and through that the motors and sensors connected to the brick.

You will work in teams of 2 throughout the course. You will start by working through tutorials to gain familiarity with the Lego EV3 environment and Matlab, and to learn and practice engineering concepts and techniques. Then you will continue with the core part of the course: the group project. You will have the chance to come up with your own project or to choose one from a list of suggested projects, and work through the engineering, programming, and planning challenges over the course of a few weeks, with support and guidance from us (the instructors). Finally, the course will culminate in a series of project presentations.



.. comment Group mailing list

    ------------------
    
    We have created a mailing list dedicated to this group. The primary purpose is that you can ask questions and discuss problems and ideas here. Additionally, we (the instructors) are also members of the list and we will contribute to the discussion when it is helpful.
    
    If you're not already a member of the group, request to join by opening the `PKP Lego Robotics 2014 Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pkp-lego-robotics-2014>`_.
    
    Don't forget to set your email preferences so that you get immediate notifications for every post.
    
    You can email the list by writing to pkp-lego-robotics-2014 [AT] googlegroups.com.
    
    You can also access the mailing list as a forum directly from these docs on the :doc:`forum` page.



Preparation
-----------

The best preparation you can do, even before the course begins, is to look at some robots that others have built. Browse YouTube for interesting applications: search for EV3, or for the previous Mindstorms version, NXT.



Deliverables
------------

There are a few deliverables throughout the course that you should submit to the instructors. They are detailed in the relevant sections, but we collected them into a reference list here for your convenience:

#. Project idea and milestones -- July 7 (Wednesday) the latest
#. Final report (see :doc:`project`) -- July 22 (Wednesday) end of day
#. Inventories (see :doc:`inventory`) -- July 23 (Thursday) end of day
#. Presentation -- July 24 (Friday) 12:30-14:30
