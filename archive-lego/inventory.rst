LEGO Inventory
==========================================

Sorting
------------

In this course, you will use the LEGO EV3 Education Core and Education Expansion sets.

Because there are so many pieces, it is imperative that we keep them sorted in the provided boxes. The reason is twofold:

#. This will make it easier for you to find the pieces as you're building.
#. This will make it easier for you to avoid losing pieces.

There's a recommended sorting provided by LEGO:

* Expansion set: :download:`Education Expansion Sorting.pdf<resources/Education Expansion Sorting.pdf>`



Inventory at the end of the course
----------------------------------

At the end of the course you have to make an inventory of the LEGO pieces. The inventories below show you how many pieces you should have of each type.

* Core set: :download:`Education Core Inventory.pdf<resources/Education Core Inventory.pdf>`
* Expansion set: :download:`Education Expansion Inventory.pdf<resources/Education Expansion Inventory.pdf>`

**At the end of the course, follow these steps:**

#. Print a copy of both the Core and Expansion inventories.
#. Write your names on the printed inventories.
#. For each piece type, count the number of pieces you have and write it on the printed inventories.
#. For any type that has missing pieces, mark the type clearly, and make note of the number of missing pieces.
