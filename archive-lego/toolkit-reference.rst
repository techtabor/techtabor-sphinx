Motors and Sensors in the EV3 Matlab Toolkit
============================================

The QUT EV3 Matlab toolkit provides a collection of functions to read sensors and control motors. You can see a full reference on the `QUT EV3 Matlab toolkit <https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Usage>`_ page. Here, we will go through a brief introduction to each sensor and motor type.



Motors
------

Read the `Motor Control <https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Motor+Control>`_ page for an overview of how motors are controlled in this toolkit.

The `Motors <https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Motors>`_ page contains a list of functions to control motors.



Sensors
-------

Read the `Sensor Reading <https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Sensor+Reading>`_ page for a list of available sensor modes.

For a list of available functions to manipulate sensors, check out the `Sensors <https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Sensors>`_ page.

	*Task:* Use the ``plotSensor`` function described on the pages above to observe the output of the touch sensor, the ultrasonic sensor, the gyro sensor, and the light sensor.

	The light sensor has a Reflect and an Ambient mode. What differences do you see when you plot them?
